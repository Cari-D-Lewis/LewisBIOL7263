# 1. Choose five animals from the databases given and calculate their acuity as MRA: 
 
```{R}
# assassin bug
redu_CPD = 0.76
redu_MRA <- 1/redu_CPD

# eagle
eagle_CPD = 140
eagle_MRA <- 1/eagle_CPD

# jumping spider
js_CPD = 12
js_MRA <- 1/js_CPD

# bee
bee_CPD = 0.5
bee_MRA <- 1/bee_CPD

# dragonfly
df_CPD = 2
df_MRA <- 1/df_CPD
```
 
| **Animal** | **CPD** | **MRA** |  
| :---: | :---: | :--- |
| Assassin Bug | `r redu_CPD` | `r redu_MRA`|
| Eagle | `r eagle_CPD` | `r eagle_MRA` |
| Jumping Spider | `r js_CPD` | `r js_MRA` |
| Worker Bee | `r bee_CPD` | `r bee_MRA` |
| Dragonfly | `r df_CPD` | `r df_MRA` |
 
 
# 2.Choose an image that is applicable to each of your animals own ecology (1 image for each animal) and resize that image to 512x512 dimensions:

js_img <- load.image('js_fly.jpg') # jumping spider
