# **Research Interests**  
![](Assignments/ASP1-F1_Bed_Bug.jpg)
  
My expertise is in urban ecology and evolution in indoor urban pests. I currently use bed bugs (*Cimex lectularius*) as a model organism to study parasite-host relationships at multiple geographic scales. As a species with a close-association to us---humans---they provide a unique opportunity to study how host organisms impact parasite ecology and evolution with an applied importance to human health and well-being. I'm completing my Ph.D. in the [Booth Lab](https://www.booth-lab.org) and am currently looking for a post-doc or industry position in Computational Genetics or related field.
